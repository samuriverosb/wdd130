        <p>Hello guys! My name is Samuel Riveros, but I prefer Samu. I'm 23 and I got married last May. I'm from Vi√±a del Mar, Chile and currently I'm living in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
        <p>I'm pursuing the Applied Technology BS because I've always loved programming and technology, and to one day become a Full-Stack Dev has always been my dream. I think that web design is something needed every day, everywhere in the world, and everyone should have it as a must-learn knowledge. I love the opportunity that BYU-Idaho gives to people who don't have the time or don't have the means to attend college at a specific time.</p>
        <p>I've been a member my whole life. I served a mission in Salta, Argentina. I always loved the teachings of Jesus Christ, and I always try to follow the way he showed us.</p>
        <p>I hope we can all have a good semester and get along with each other!</p>
