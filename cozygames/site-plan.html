        Do you want to relax and play some video games? 
        <br>
        Then this is the site for you!

        <br>
        Potion Permit: Healing the town of Moonbury
        <br>
        In Potion Permit, players take on the role of a medical chemist assigned to the small town of Moonbury, where the residents are initially somewhat suspicious of the player. However, as they establish relationships and develop their craft, they begin to foster a place for themself in the community.
        Available on Steam, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4 and 5, with an Xbox release coming soon.
        <br>
        <br>
        Dorfromantik
        <br>
        Board games can often turn out to be the complete opposite of cozy games - just try a family game of Monopoly over Christmas. But despite an initially overwhelming board, Dorfromantik turns out to be a low-pressure delight. Much like the satisfaction that comes from terraforming in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Dorfromantik has you combining hexagonal tiles to build your own little slice of country life.
        Available on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series X and S.
        <br>
        <br>
        Animal Crossing: New Horizons
        <br>
        With lovable NPCs, boundless character customization, day-to-day tasks, and tiny homes to decorate, Animal Crossing: New Horizons hits several of the most important identifiers of cozy games. It's one of those games that you sink hours upon hours into, sometimes taking hiatuses from playing, but always getting drawn back in eventually.
        Exclusive for Nintendo Switch.
        <br>
        <br>
        Unpacking
        <br>
        Unpacking was an immediate success upon its release toward the end of 2021. It's easy to see why: there's immense attention to detail, the underlying story prompts emotional involvement, and the block puzzle aspect of the game is a relaxing act of repetition sure to help with de-stressing.
        Available only on PC (Epic Games & Steam).
        <br>
        <br>
        Night in the Woods
        <br>
        Night in the Woods is a cozy game that can heal your inner child and prompt some serious introspection. Great humor and adorable little animal NPCs aside, the story that this game tells is touching and easy to relate to personal struggles.
        Exclusive for Nintendo Switch.
        <br>
        <br>
        Disney Dreamlight Valley
        <br>
        Animal Crossing was long the undisputed king of the relaxing life sim - but Disney may well be the one brand that could give the Nintendo game a run for its money as the cozy game of choice. The Avengers of Disney games, Disney Dreamlight Valley sees you explore the titular land of Dreamlight Valley, interacting with fan-favourite Disney and Pixar characters as you fish, cook, and generally bring magic back to the valley.
        Available for all platforms.
        <br>
        <br>
        Abzu
        <br>
        Abzu gives you the tranquility of being alone as they control a solitary diver in a vast ocean. Though nothing else close to human waits in the depths of the water, there is plenty of life to seek out. Dolphins spring past the sea's surface, schools of fish swarm together, and manatees laze around in kelp forests. The marine environment in Abzu is massive and fleshed out beautifully for such a short game.
        Availabe on all platforms.
