        <strong>Cozy Games</strong>
        <br>
        Do you want to relax and play some video games? 
        <br>
        Then this is the site for you!
        <br>
        <br>
        Animal Crossing: New Horizons
        <br>
            With lovable NPCs, boundless character customization, day-to-day tasks, and tiny homes to decorate, Animal Crossing: 
            New Horizons hits several of the most important identifiers of cozy games. It's one of those games that you sink hours 
            upon hours into, sometimes taking hiatuses from playing, but always getting drawn back in eventually.
        <br>
        <br>
        Potion Permit: Healing the town of Moonbury
        <br>
            In Potion Permit, players take on the role of a medical chemist assigned to the small town of Moonbury, where the 
            residents are initially somewhat suspicious of the player. However, as they establish relationships and develop their 
            craft, they begin to foster a place for themself in the community.
        <br>
        <br>
        Dorfromantik
        <br>
            Board games can often turn out to be the complete opposite of cozy games. But despite an initially overwhelming board, Dorfromantik turns out to be a low-pressure delight. Much 
            like the satisfaction that comes from terraforming in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Dorfromantik has you combining 
            hexagonal tiles to build your own little slice of country life. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Unpacking
        <br>
            Unpacking was an immediate success upon its release toward the end of 2021. It's easy to see why: there's immense 
            attention to detail, the underlying story prompts emotional involvement, and the block puzzle aspect of the game is 
            a relaxing act of repetition sure to help with de-stressing.
        <br>
        <br>
        Night in the Woods
        <br>
            Night in the Woods is a cozy game that can heal your inner child and prompt some serious introspection. 
            Great humor and adorable little animal NPCs aside, the story that this game tells is touching and easy to 
            relate to personal struggles.
        <br>
        <br>
        Disney Dreamlight Valley
        <br>
            Animal Crossing was long the undisputed king of the relaxing life sim - but Disney may well be the one brand 
            that could give the Nintendo game a run for its money as the cozy game of choice. The Avengers of Disney games, 
            Disney Dreamlight Valley sees you explore the titular land of Dreamlight Valley, interacting with fan-favourite Disney 
            and Pixar characters as you fish, cook, and generally bring magic back to the valley.
        <br>
        <br>
        Abzu
        <br>
            Abzu gives you the tranquility of being alone as they control a solitary diver in a vast ocean. Though nothing else 
            close to human waits in the depths of the water, there is plenty of life to seek out. Dolphins spring past the sea's 
            surface, schools of fish swarm together, and manatees laze around in kelp forests. The marine environment in Abzu is 
            massive and fleshed out beautifully for such a short game.
        <br>
        <br>
        Bear And Breakfast
        <br>
            Have you ever wanted to take up the role of a bear who runs a bed and breakfast in a cozy little woodland area? Are 
            you interested in making adorable animal friends and unknowingly accepting quests from deities? Well, Bear and Breakfast 
            is your chance to do all three, somehow.
        <br>
        <br>
        Stardew Valley
        <br>
            With its colorful graphics, endearing soundtrack, and varied cast of characters that render it 
            impossible not to pick favorites, this game was bound to be iconic. In this game that’s still seeing somewhat frequent updates and new features added, 
            grow crops, raise animals, plan your harvests, get to know the townsfolk, explore the mines, enter a cute but harrowing combat 
            system, and live out your days in farmstead bliss.
        <br>
        <br>
        Journey
        <br>
            Journey is a unique game in that, while you play it with other people, you don’t actually speak to them. In the game, you 
            communicate through a series of chimes, working together to try to solve puzzles and progress on your, well, journey. 
            Sometimes, it felt like this game was more of an art piece than anything. The landscaping feels infinite and leaves you 
            feeling comfortably small, the music is epic and swells as you travel, and the gameplay itself is smooth and easy.

        Hi! My name is Samuel Riveros, and I'm the creator of Cozy Games. Let me tell you the story behind it. I came back from a long day at work.
        I got yelled by my boss, had a lot in my to-do list and I could barely finish it. I was exhausted, and all I wanted to do was to sit down, 
        turn on my Playstation and have some fun playing videogames. I entered in a lobby in Modern Warfare and a kid started yelling at me on how 
        I was bad at playing, and a lot of stuff I shouldn't mention if you are under age. And then I realized: 'Hold on a minute, I was trying to get
        away from all the screaming and stress. Not stressing me to death.' And that's how it all came to my mind. 'What if there was a web page full of
        cozy games just to relax and have fun with friends?' And that's how Cozy Games was born!
